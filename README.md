# QGIS tutorial
Want to get started with QGIS, but have no clue what to do?? You're in the right place! 

Originally created for a QGIS workshop, but the materials are open for everyone to use/copy/improve.  

There are three basic tasks with instructions and sample data in the sample_data folder.

## Other useful materials  
Need a background map? Add an XYZ tile layer from OpenStreetMap and you will always have background maps at hand. Add the following URL in the Browser dialog to the XYZ tiles layer:  
https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
